1. Load the OFET structure

2. For every device, store its molecular weight and mobility in an nx2 array.. [MW, mob?; more?]

3. use isnan(x) to replace all the NaN values with the average of the actual existing defined MWs

4. make a plot of mobility vs. MW

5. do a least squared regression on it

6. Update the structure so that all the NaN values now have the average MW, and save it.

7. Make a procedure to add new papers

8. Do a lasso regression on MW, PDI, RR, HR, boiling point
